# Machine Learning & Data Science Course

An organized 120-day challenge to build practical skills in Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS). This repository contains daily exercises, resources, and mini-projects to accelerate learning and portfolio building.

## Overview
- **Curriculum length:** 120 days
- **Focus areas:** Python, data handling, statistics, ML algorithms, model evaluation, and deployment basics
- **Source of materials:** Intelligence Academy (curated resources and adapted exercises)
- **License:** MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE)

## Repository Structure
- `01_day/` — Day 01 exercises and notes
    - `Challenge_01.py`
    - `Challenge_02.py`
    - `Challenge_03.py`
    - `Challenge_04.py`
    - `day_01.md`

## Day 01 — Challenges
The first day introduces Python fundamentals and numeric operations essential for data work. Below are the challenge themes as outlined in `01_day/day_01.md`:

- **Challenge 01: The Identity Swap**
    - Practice variable assignment, swapping values, and verifying identity vs equality.
    - Typical tasks: swap two variables without a temporary variable, check `is` vs `==` for immutable types.

- **Challenge 02: The Type Auditor**
    - Inspect and convert between core Python types (int, float, str, bool).
    - Typical tasks: validate inputs, cast safely, and assert expected types for computations.

- **Challenge 03: The Precision Banker**
    - Handle numeric precision and rounding for financial-style calculations.
    - Typical tasks: use `round()`, `decimal.Decimal`, format values, and avoid floating-point pitfalls.

- **Challenge 04: The Modulo Architect**
    - Apply modulo arithmetic to build cyclic logic and partition data.
    - Typical tasks: even/odd checks, bucket indexing, wrap-around sequences.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
2. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/anikasadiaOPT/Machine_Learning-Data_Science-Course.git

3. Explore Day 01:
     ```bash
     tree 01_day
     python3 01_day/Challenge_01.py
     python3 01_day/Challenge_02.py
     python3 01_day/Challenge_03.py
     python3 01_day/Challenge_04.py
     ```
